# flutter_basic_widgets


# Starting Flutter Journey

This repository contains a series of Flutter projects and code samples demonstrating key concepts and widgets used in Flutter development. The goal is to help new developers understand the building blocks of Flutter apps and provide hands-on examples of how to use widgets like Row, Column, Container, and more.

## Projects

1. **Basic Layouts**: Demonstrates the use of Row, Column, and Flex for building responsive layouts.
2. **Stateless vs Stateful Widgets**: A simple counter app that shows the difference between stateless and stateful widgets.
3. **UI Elements Showcase**: Contains examples of common UI elements such as Text, Icon, Image, and ElevatedButton.
4. **Advanced Widgets**: Demonstrates the use of Scaffold, AppBar, and custom containers for more complex layouts.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn!
